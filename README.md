# Varicose-Vein-Analysis
Utilizing R for data analysis and visualization, this project investigates the relationships between patient status and various factors, providing insights into the significant associations and correlations that can inform healthcare decisions. The analysis is based on a dataset provided by Professor Hossein Abouee Mehrizi for the Operations Analytics course (MSE 719) in the Management Science and Engineering department at the University of Waterloo.

Despite its prevalence, varicose vein disease remains poorly understood, with limited research on the relationships between demographic factors and disease status. This analysis aims to fill this knowledge gap by exploring the associations between varicose vein status and gender, parental history, and age, providing a foundation for future research and improved disease management.

Objectives
- Examine the association between patient status and gender.
- Investigate the relationship between patient status and parental history.
- Analyze the connection between patient status and age.
- Determine which of gender, parental history, and age has the most significant impact on patient status.

Methodology
- Data cleaning and preparation using R
- Contingency tables and bar plots to visualize relationships
- Chi-squared tests to determine significant associations

Findings
- Significant association between patient status and gender.
- Significant association between patient status and parental history.
- Significant association between patient status and age, with age having the most significant impact on varicose vein status.

Code and Data
- R code for data analysis and visualization: varicose_vein_analysis.R
- Dataset: patients_dataset.csv (provided by Professor Hossein Abouee Mehrizi for academic purposes only)

Requirements
- R version 4.1.0 or higher
- RStudio or similar IDE

Acknowledgments
- Dataset provided by Professor Hossein Abouee Mehrizi for the Operations Analytics course.

Conclusion
- While this analysis provides valuable insights into the relationships between varicose vein status and demographic factors, it is not without limitations. Future research should aim to address these limitations by exploring additional risk factors, incorporating larger and more diverse datasets, and developing more advanced analytical models. By continuing to investigate varicose vein disease, we can work towards improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of this condition.
